# chrome-trex-game
A game made in pure javaScript HTML and CSS


Hello and welcome to another JavaScript Game Walkthrough!

In this walkthrough, I show you how to build the popular Dino Chrome Game in pure JavaScript, HTML and CSS, no fancy frameworks required! We also will not be using Canvas, we are going to be using pure JavaScript logic for everything!

I like this tutorial as we really focus on nodes, so adding Children to parents using .appendChild(), but also removing them using .removeChild() and a few others.

I will also be showing you how to make sure your code is the best possible version of itself it can be by using a platform called Embold. I will walk you through this step by step at the end so make sure not to miss.

### UPDATE: 
I collaborate with Embold and they provide us with a 20% off discount code as well!

Thanks for coding along with me! I would love to see your finished games, how you have taken them to that extra level! Please do share them with me on Twitter, Instagram, or Youtube!
